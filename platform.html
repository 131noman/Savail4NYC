                                    The current income-based tax system lets the ultra-wealthy off the hook. Many of the
                                    richest Americans report little to no income, despite controlling hundreds of
                                    millions to billions in assets. They use those assets as collateral to borrow at low
                                    interest rates, avoiding income taxes entirely. This isn’t a loophole, it’s a design
                                    failure.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We propose a Ultra-Wealthy tax equal to 1% plus the previous year’s GDP
                                    growth, as reported by a federal index (such as the Bureau of Economic
                                    Analysis). For example, if GDP grew by 2%, the tax would be 3% on total net worth
                                    for individuals with over $100 million in assets.

                                    This is not radical, it’s a modest and responsive mechanism based on how the
                                    ultra-wealthy actually build wealth: faster than the economy itself. This tax simply
                                    ensures that when the country grows, those who benefit most also help sustain it.

                                    Beyond these red lines, I will oppose all foreign military aid, even to traditional
                                    allies, until we have guaranteed the following for the American people:
                                </p>

                                    Ceasefire demands in regions like Gaza are the bare minimum, but they are not
                                    enough. We need binding legal prohibitions on military aid that are conditioned on
                                    both domestic justice and international accountability.

                                    I recognize that this approach may unsettle some allies, but there are multilateral
                                    institutions such as NATO to fill temporary gaps. The truth is, America must finally
                                    confront its toxic dependence on the military-industrial complex, a dependency that
                                    fuels war, destabilizes regions, and enriches defense contractors at the expense of
                                    human life.

                                    We must also confront the political stranglehold that prevents accountability. At
                                    the heart of this impasse lies a false binary perpetuated by the Zionist political
                                    establishment: “Our survival requires your complicity, and refusing that complicity
                                    is antisemitic.” That framing is undemocratic and dangerously manipulative.

                                    The reality is this: Congress will never defund Israel directly, not while it's
                                    effectively owned by foreign lobbying interests. The only viable path is to abolish
                                    foreign military aid entirely—no loopholes, no exceptions, full detachment.
                                </p>

                                    We face a choice: support our allies blindly, or stop being complicit in genocide.
                                    Choosing complicity not only violates our conscience, it corrodes the very
                                    foundation of American democracy. If we fund atrocities, we forfeit the right to
                                    speak of liberty, justice, or dignity. In that case, the American project has

                                    This transformation is about more than war, it’s about economic justice and
                                    structural repair. It calls out our second addiction: a capitalist model of endless
                                    extraction, which demands rising profits no matter the cost in human life. This
                                    system has gutted the Global South, sustained neocolonialism, and created a global
                                    class of indentured labor.

                                    If we want to solve the immigration crisis, we must stop enabling the economic
                                    conditions that displace millions. The first step: end the funneling of American
                                    resources into foreign militaries and exploitative regimes.

                                    This policy is unapologetically simple: Take care of Americans first. Stop funding
                                    violence abroad. Prioritize people over power. Replace performative patriotism with
                                    real justice.

                                    Some may claim this sounds un-American, illegal, or even antithetical to capitalism.
                                    But it is none of those things. In fact, we already tolerate and regulate monopolies
                                    in essential services i.e. electricity, water, gas, even cable, despite the
                                    foundational illegality of monopolies in a free market. Why? Because as a society,
                                    we recognize that in certain sectors, unrestricted competition can undermine the
                                    public good. Health care is no different, except that its consequences are even more
                                    immediate and deadly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To be American is to believe in markets, but also to recognize that when the private
                                    sector threatens the public good, it is both legal and moral to apply the least
                                    restrictive measures needed to protect people. A modest cap on profit is one such
                                    measure, and it’s long overdue.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Importantly, this proposal is not radical. Most major insurers already operate
                                    within this range. Industry profit margins typically fall between 1% and 4%, with
                                    many earning around 1.5% to 3%. This plan doesn’t dismantle the business model, it
                                    simply formalizes what we already know is sustainable, and aligns it with the public
                                    interest.

                                <p>
                                    As it stands, the insurance industry too often functions more like a societal
                                    parasite
                                    than
                                    a collective ally, siphoning money from suffering rather than preventing it. If this
                                    system
                                    is going to remain private, it must act in the interest of the public good. A fair

                                    on
                                    profits is not just common sense, it’s a small but vital step toward a healthcare
                                    system
                                    that finally works for everyone.

                                <p>America’s economy is built on the backs of working people, yet workers have virtually
                                    no say in how major corporations are run. It’s time to change that. I will introduce
                                    a bill requiring legally mandated representation of non-executive, non-management
                                    employees on the boards of directors of all publicly traded companies, modeled after
                                    the doctrine of co-determination in countries like Germany.</p>

                                <p>This proposal is the most immediate, tangible, and accessible labor reform within
                                    today’s political climate, giving working people a seat at the table where decisions
                                    about wages, layoffs, safety, and job security are actually made.</p>

                                <p>Whether or not the bill passes, it will do something powerful: force every member of
                                    Congress to go on the record, to show whether they are truly committed to uplifting
                                    the working class or merely paying lip service. This is about transparency,
                                    accountability, and shifting the balance of power toward those who do the work, not
                                    just those who reap the rewards.</p>

                                <p>Corporate executives should have to look the very people they affect in the eye.
                                    Decisions about mass layoffs, stagnant wages, or speed-up policies feel different
                                    when the voices of workers are right there in the room. A disgruntled workforce is
                                    an inefficient workforce, and even worse is a fearful one. Shared power breeds
                                    better outcomes for morale, productivity, and justice alike.</p>

                                <p>And if corporations are to be treated as people under the law, then we must recognize
                                    that their soul is not found solely in the corner office, but in the collective
                                    heartbeat of their wage-earning workers. Any structure that excludes those workers
                                    from power is not only unjust, it is inhuman.</p>

                                <p>This isn’t about punishing success, it’s about protecting the people who make that
                                    success possible.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Unlimited contributions:</strong> Donors—whether individuals,
                                        corporations, or unions—could give unlimited amounts of money to influence
                                        elections.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Direct corporate political spending:</strong> Corporations and other
                                        artificial entities gained the explicit right to spend directly on political
                                        advocacy, treating their treasury funds as “speech.”</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hidden donor identities:</strong> Much of this spending could be routed
                                        through nonprofits and shell organizations, allowing donors to remain anonymous
                                        to the public.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>This ruling unleashed a flood of dark money that has warped the priorities of
                                    Congress, creating a political class more enamored with celebrity status than public
                                    service, and reserving meaningful access to those with immense wealth.</p>

                                <p>This is a profound breach of the unspoken social contract: that elected
                                    representatives act as fiduciaries of the public trust, required to exercise power
                                    and allocate resources solely for the benefit of the people, not as brokers selling
                                    that power to the highest bidder. Today, the benefits of that trust flow almost
                                    entirely in one direction: toward the consolidation of wealth, the deepening of
                                    political inequality, and the entrenchment of a permanent ruling class.</p>

                                <p>I will fight for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, establish
                                    full transparency in all political contributions, and eliminate dark money from
                                    federal elections. This means:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mandatory real-time disclosure of every dollar spent to influence an election,
                                        including the ultimate, original source of funds.</li>
                                    <li>Closing the 501(c)(4) loophole that enables corporations and foreign interests
                                        to launder donations through opaque nonprofits.</li>
                                    <li>Strict campaign spending limits to prevent oligarchs from treating candidates
                                        like personal assets.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Our democracy cannot endure if electoral outcomes are determined by wealth rather
                                    than the will of the people. The federal government must once again be the
                                    beneficiary of the people’s trust, not the pawn of those who can afford to purchase
                                    it.</p>

                                <p>The affordability crisis isn’t bad luck, it’s the result of powerful corporations
                                    cornering markets, controlling supply chains, and setting prices with no real
                                    competition. When a handful of companies dominate an industry, prices go up, quality
                                    goes down, and small businesses get pushed out.</p>
                                <p>We see it everywhere: meatpacking giants driving up the cost of beef and chicken, an
                                    egg industry dominated by a few producers charging record prices during shortages,
                                    seed and pesticide monopolies like Monsanto keeping farmers dependent and prices
                                    high, and pharmaceutical companies blocking cheaper generics to protect their
                                    profits. This is why groceries cost more, why gas spikes without warning, and why
                                    prescription drugs are unaffordable for millions.</p>
                                <p>For farmers, monopolies are an existential threat. A small number of agribusiness
                                    giants now control the markets for seeds, feed, fertilizer, and the processors who
                                    buy their crops and livestock. This means farmers often have only one or two buyers
                                    to sell to and those buyers dictate the price. At the same time, monopolistic
                                    suppliers hike the cost of essential inputs, locking farmers into debt and
                                    dependency. It’s a squeeze from both ends: they’re paid less for what they produce,
                                    and they pay more for what they need to keep producing. This system destroys family
                                    farms, hollows out rural economies, and forces the next generation off the land.</p>
                                <p>Breaking up monopolies isn’t about punishing success it’s about making sure no
                                    company can strangle competition or squeeze working Americans, from grocery shoppers
                                    to the farmers who feed them.</p>
                                <p>Congress needs to join the fight, not leave it to regulators alone. I will push for
                                    legislation to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ban mergers that make already-dominant corporations even bigger.</li>
                                    <li>Break up companies that inflate prices or lock out competition.</li>
                                    <li>Stop vertical integration in critical sectors like food, energy, and tech that
                                        allows one company to control every step from production to sale.</li>
                                    <li>Give states more power to go after price-fixing and anti-competitive behavior
                                        without waiting for Washington.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>History shows that when monopolies are broken up, consumers benefit. When the U.S.
                                    government forced the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, energy prices fell, and
                                    innovation surged. When AT&T’s telephone monopoly was dismantled in 1984,
                                    competition drove down long-distance rates and fueled the telecom revolution. More
                                    recently, actions against tech giants and agribusiness monopolies have shown that
                                    challenging concentrated corporate power leads to lower costs and more choice. If we
                                    want lower prices on essentials like food, fuel, and medicine—and if we want farmers
                                    to earn a fair living for honest work, we must restore real competition and take the
                                    power back from the corporate giants who’ve rigged the market in their favor.</p>
