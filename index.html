	<p></p>
<p>Four terms max. No lobbying—when I step down, I’m done. I won’t turn around and work for the same corporate or political interests I fought against. No cozying up to party bosses. I’ll fight for housing, healthcare, and fair wages, then step aside for the next generation. Too many in Congress treat their seats like lifetime appointments, turning the place into something resembling both a country club and a nursing home, when it should be the beating heart of America’s future.</p>
<p>Our survival as a democracy is at stake. If we don’t break the grip of career politicians and the special interests that own them, we risk losing the very foundation of our republic. Stand with me to open the doors of Congress to the next generation and build a government that works for the people, not the powerful.</p>

									<p>New Yorkers hustle, adapt, and show up for one another. But we shouldn’t have to fight alone for basic needs like housing, healthcare, or safe infrastructure. Washington has failed us, and it shows in our daily lives.</p>

									<p>I’m running for Congress here in New York City, not because I planned to, but because I believe this city deserves a federal government as bold and resilient as its people.</p>

									<p>My background spans continents, from public schools in the Midwest to international classrooms in Tokyo and Singapore, where I learned to navigate cultures, challenge systems, and build bridges. Living and working in Mexico deepened my understanding of immigrant struggles and reinforced my belief in justice rooted in solidarity, humility, and inclusion.</p>

									<p>But it wasn’t until I came to New York that things finally clicked. After a life spent searching for belonging, New York, a city of misfits, dreamers, and fighters, was the first place that ever truly felt like home. In its chaos and complexity, I found clarity. I wasn’t lost anymore.</p>

									<p>The journey that brought me here gave me the tools to help others find belonging too, to their country. I’m running to end a system where democracy feels like monarchy, rigged for the ultra-wealthy, with one set of rules for them and another for us. They cry “socialism” when we demand fair and livable wages or healthcare, but stay quiet about corporate bailouts, tax breaks, and loopholes for the rich. That’s not capitalism; it’s feudalism in disguise. I’m fighting for a system that’s accessible, transparent, and actually works for the people it’s meant to serve. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong, and that they have the power to shape this country.</p>

									<p>But after years in the commercial space, I came to a sobering realization: no amount of professional success can compensate for the emptiness of a system where so many are denied stability, dignity, and opportunity. That truth became personal just months ago, when I was scheduled to undergo life-saving brain surgery, only to have my health insurance deny coverage the day before the procedure.</p>

									<p>I was lucky. With the help of friends, family, and a network of advocates, I got the care I needed. But I couldn’t stop thinking: what happens to those without that support? The answer is devastating and unacceptable. The work may have been exciting and cutting-edge, but it felt increasingly hollow in a country where democracy, economic mobility, and healthcare remain out of reach for millions. A truly thriving economy cannot exist without a functioning democracy that delivers for everyone.</p>

									<p>After years of living and working in New York, I’ve seen firsthand how badly we need federal leadership that actually delivers. Our city pays more and gets less on healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and more. It’s time we changed that.</p>

									<p>I’m running to bring that change with experience, urgency, and a deep commitment to people over profits and justice over gridlock.</p>

								<button class="collapsible" style="text-align: Center;">Affordable Housing & Tenant Rights</button>
								<div class="content" display="none">
									<p></p>
									
									<h2>The Foreign Ownership Fairness Act</h2>
										<p>To combat artificial demand and absentee speculation, this bill would limit foreign nationals to the purchase of only one residential property in the United States, and only for personal use.</p>
										
										Key provisions include:<br><br>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Foreign nationals may own one residential unit only, no bulk buying, no real estate hoarding.</li>	
									<li>Residential properties left vacant for more than 180 days by foreign owners would incur a federal vacancy tax.</li>
									<li>Corporations or shell entities linked to non-residents would be prohibited from purchasing additional units and individuals linked to any such entity shall be precluded from owning any property. </li>
									</ul></ul>
									<br>This proposal directly reduces speculative demand, curbs gentrification pressure, and makes more housing available and affordable to the people who actually live and work in our communities.
									<p></p>
									<h2>The Federal Renters’ Bill of Rights</h2>
									<p>This legislation would establish national baseline protections for all renters, especially in properties receiving federal subsidies or tax incentives. Key rights include:</p>
									
									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Safe, Habitable Housing</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
										
									<li>Enforceable federal standards for maintenance, pests, air quality, mold, heating, and water access.</li>
									
										<li> Emergency federal funding for urgent “livability” repairs and utility access in under-resourced communities.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Just-Cause Eviction Protections</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Landlords must provide legitimate cause (e.g., non-payment, lease violation) for eviction.</li>
									<li>Ends arbitrary or retaliatory evictions.</li></ul></ul>
									
									
									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Lease Renewal Protections</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Tenants in good standing cannot be denied renewal without just cause.</li>
									<li>Ensures housing stability in rapidly gentrifying or high-demand neighborhoods.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Counsel in Eviction Proceedings</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Federal funding to guarantee legal representation for low- and middle-income tenants.</li>
									<li>Modeled on successful city-level programs like New York City’s Right to Counsel law.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Reasonable Rent Increases</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Federally capped rent increases on subsidized units (e.g., CPI + 3% annually).</li>
									<li>Enables cities and states to build on this floor with stronger protections.</li>
										</ul></ul>

									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Anti-Discrimination Protections</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Nationwide ban on source-of-income discrimination (e.g., against Section 8 voucher holders).</li>
									<li>Enhanced enforcement of existing Fair Housing laws.</li>
									</ul></ul>

									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Organize and Collective Bargain</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Federal protections for tenant unions and associations against retaliation.</li>
									<li>Support for collective bargaining on rent, maintenance, and building conditions.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h6 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Transparency</strong></h6>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Tenants must be informed of the actual owners and financial interests behind their landlords.</li>
									<li>Mandatory disclosure of rent history, prior code violations, and government subsidies.</li>
										</ul></ul>

								<!-- Pillar Two -->
								<button class="collapsible" style="text-align: Center;">Corporate Greed & Excess Wealth</button>
								<div class="content">
									<div style="height: 10px;"></div>
									For decades, multinational corporations and ultra-wealthy individuals have extracted billions in profits from our communities while contributing less and less to the public good. It’s time to end this extraction economy and rewrite the tax code to work for working people and ensure that companies benefiting from America’s workforce and infrastructure are paying their fair share to sustain it.
									<div style="height: 10px;"></div>
									<h2 style="text-align: left;"> A Fair Share Act</h2>
							
										I will push for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate tax code that:
										<ul><ul>
										<li>Eliminates tax loopholes and offshore shelters.</li>
											<li>Enforces a minimum effective tax rate for large corporations.</li>
											<li>Prevents corporations from deducting stock buybacks, lobbying expenses, or executive bonuses from their taxes.</li>
											<li>Requires public reporting of corporate tax liabilities and effective tax rates.</li>
										

										</ul></ul>
									<h2 style="text-align: left;">A National Net Worth Tax on Ultra-Wealthy Individuals</h2>
										<p>The current income-based tax system lets the ultra-wealthy off the hook. Many of the richest Americans report little to no income, despite controlling hundreds of millions to billions in assets. They use those assets as collateral to borrow at low interest rates, avoiding income taxes entirely. This isn’t a loophole, it’s a design failure.</p>
										<p>We propose a Ultra-Wealthy tax equal to 1% plus the previous year’s GDP growth, as reported by a federal index (such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis). For example, if GDP grew by 2%, the tax would be 3% on total net worth for individuals with over $100 million in assets.</p>
										<p>This is not radical, it’s a modest and responsive mechanism based on how the ultra-wealthy actually build wealth: faster than the economy itself. This tax simply ensures that when the country grows, those who benefit most also help sustain it.</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: left;">This tax would apply to:</h3>
										<ul><ul>
											<li>Stocks, real estate, private equity, art, yachts, and trusts.</li>
											<li>Shell company holdings.</li>
											<li>Assets leveraged for loans, whether technically “owned” or “borrowed against.”</li>
										</ul></ul>
								
									<h3 style="text-align: left;">What It Funds: Real Returns for the American People</h2>
									<strong>Real Revenue Gains</strong>
									<p>The top 0.01% of U.S. households control over $18 trillion in wealth. Assuming an average GDP growth of 2–3%, the effective tax rate would hover around 3–4% annually, generating:</p>
									
									<ul><ul>
										<li>$540–720 billion per year, conservatively.</li>
										<li>As much as $900 billion+ in strong economic years.</li>
						
									<strong style="text-align: left;">This revenue could fully fund or dramatically expand:</strong>
										<p style="height: 1px;"></p>
										<li>Medicare for All</li>
										<li>Tuition-free public college and vocational programs</li>
										<li>National affordable housing construction</li>
										<li>Green energy and climate resilience projects</li>
										<li>Universal pre-K and childcare access</li>
										<li>Modernized public transit systems</li>
									</ul>	
									</ul>
									<p>All without raising taxes on 99.9% of Americans and potentially lowering them!</p>
									<p>This isn’t about punishment, it’s about preservation. If democracy is to survive, those who have gained the most from it must begin to invest back into it. This tax is a first step toward rebalancing a system that has long asked everything from working people and almost nothing from the top.</p>

								<!-- Pillar Three -->
								<button class="collapsible" style="text-align: Center;">No Tax Dollars for Genodide</button>
								
								<div class="content">
								<h3>No Complicity in Atrocities</h3>
		<p>I will not vote for any legislation—regardless of which party presents it—unless it includes clear and enforceable provisions to immediately end all economic and military aid to Israel and any other nation suspected of committing genocide, ethnic cleansing, or violations of international law.</p>


		<p>No U.S. tax dollars shall go to any foreign government that stands in breach of these principles. The United States must finally end its complicity in war crimes and systemic oppression by halting all financial and military support to nations that violate fundamental human rights.</p>
	
		<h3>No Military Aid Without Meeting Basic Needs at Home</h3>
		
		<p>Beyond these red lines, I will oppose all foreign military aid, even to traditional allies, until we have guaranteed the following for the American people:</p>

		<ul><ul>
			<li>Universal, affordable healthcare</li>

			<li>Accessible, affordable childcare</li>

			<li>Tuition-free higher education for any student who cannot afford it</li>
		</ul></ul>
<p>Ceasefire demands in regions like Gaza are the bare minimum, but they are not enough. We need binding legal prohibitions on military aid that are conditioned on both domestic justice and international accountability.</p>
		
<p>I recognize that this approach may unsettle some allies, but there are multilateral institutions such as NATO to fill temporary gaps. The truth is, America must finally confront its toxic dependence on the military-industrial complex,a dependency that fuels war, destabilizes regions, and enriches defense contractors at the expense of human life.</p>
		
<p>We must also confront the political stranglehold that prevents accountability. At the heart of this impasse lies a false binary perpetuated by the Zionist political establishment: “Our survival requires your complicity, and refusing that complicity is antisemitic.” That framing is undemocratic and dangerously manipulative.</p>
<p>The reality is this: Congress will never defund Israel directly, not while it's effectively owned by foreign lobbying interests. The only viable path is to abolish foreign military aid entirely—no loopholes, no exceptions, full detachment.</p>
<p>We face a choice: support our allies blindly, or stop being complicit in genocide. Choosing complicity not only violates our conscience, it corrodes the very foundation of American democracy. If we fund atrocities, we forfeit the right to speak of liberty, justice, or dignity. In that case, the American project has failed.</p>
<p>This transformation is about more than war, it’s about economic justice and structural repair. It calls out our second addiction: a capitalist model of endless extraction, which demands rising profits no matter the cost in human life. This system has gutted the Global South, sustained neocolonialism, and created a global class of indentured labor.</p>
 <p>If we want to solve the immigration crisis, we must stop enabling the economic conditions that displace millions. The first step: end the funneling of American resources into foreign militaries and exploitative regimes.</p>
<p>This policy is unapologetically simple: Take care of Americans first. Stop funding violence abroad. Prioritize people over power. Replace performative patriotism with real justice.</p>

								</div>
								<p></p>

								<!-- Pillar Four -->
								<button class="collapsible" style="text-align: Center;">A Broken Health System</button>
								<div class="content">
									<p></p>
									<h3>Accountability</h3>
										<p>While full healthcare reform remains a vital and long-term goal, one that will require changing the foundational thinking and intentions of both major parties, we cannot wait for those systemic shifts to begin improving people’s lives today. In the meantime, we can take immediate, achievable steps by holding insurance companies accountable. Too often, they break the very promises embedded in their policies.</p> 
										<p>I will champion legislation that imposes serious financial penalties, and even criminal liability, on fiduciaries of health insurance companies who reject life-critical claims. These violations will be treated as status offenses, meaning that patients won’t need to go to court to prove harm. A simple rejection will be enough.</p> 
										<p>This isn’t about bureaucracy, it’s about survival. And it's time someone stood up for the insured, not the insurers.</p>
									<h3>Affordability</h3>
									<p>While universal health care remains the ultimate goal, and may eventually require a shift beyond privatization to a nationalized system, we need immediate, tangible wins. Too many Americans are currently denied essential care, and urgent reforms are necessary to restore fairness, dignity, and access.</p> 
									<p>For now, we must acknowledge that health insurance will continue to exist as a private enterprise. But it cannot remain one that profits by denying care. To rebalance the system, I will introduce legislation to legally cap the allowable profit margin of private health insurance companies at 1.5% of total annual revenue, with a firm 2% ceiling, beyond which all excess profit is redirected to national healthcare trust funds.</p> 
									<p>Some may claim this sounds un-American, illegal, or even antithetical to capitalism. But it is none of those things. In fact, we already tolerate and regulate monopolies in essential services i.e. electricity, water, gas, even cable, despite the foundational illegality of monopolies in a free market. Why? Because as a society, we recognize that in certain sectors, unrestricted competition can undermine the public good. Health care is no different, except that its consequences are even more immediate and deadly.</p> 
									<p>To be American is to believe in markets, but also to recognize that when the private sector threatens the public good, it is both legal and moral to apply the least restrictive measures needed to protect people. A modest cap on profit is one such measure, and it’s long overdue.</p> 
									<p>Importantly, this proposal is not radical. Most major insurers already operate within this range. Industry profit margins typically fall between 1% and 4%, with many earning around 1.5% to 3%. This plan doesn’t dismantle the business model, it simply formalizes what we already know is sustainable, and aligns it with the public interest. 
									</p>
									<p>This reform would: </p>
									<ul>
									<li>Keep insurers financially viable and competitive</li>	
									<li>Prevent profiteering in life-and-death decisions</li>
									<li>Promote care-driven business models over denial-based strategies</li>
									<li>Balance shareholder interests with a moral obligation to patients</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
									As it stands, the insurance industry too often functions more like a societal parasite than a collective ally, siphoning money from suffering rather than preventing it. If this system is going to remain private, it must act in the interest of the public good. A fair cap on profits is not just common sense, it’s a small but vital step toward a healthcare system that finally works for everyone.

								<button class="collapsible" style="text-align: Center;">Empowering Labor & Wage Earners</button>
								<div class="content">
									<p>America’s economy is built on the backs of working people, yet workers have virtually no say in how major corporations are run. It’s time to change that. I will introduce a bill requiring legally mandated representation of non-executive, non-management employees on the boards of directors of all publicly traded companies, modeled after the doctrine of co-determination in countries like Germany.</p>
					
									<p>This proposal is the most immediate, tangible, and accessible labor reform within today’s political climate, giving working people a seat at the table where decisions about wages, layoffs, safety, and job security are actually made.</p>
									<p>Whether or not the bill passes, it will do something powerful: force every member of Congress to go on the record, to show whether they are truly committed to uplifting the working class or merely paying lip service. This is about transparency, accountability, and shifting the balance of power toward those who do the work, not just those who reap the rewards.</p>
									<p>Corporate executives should have to look the very people they affect in the eye. Decisions about mass layoffs, stagnant wages, or speed-up policies feel different when the voices of workers are right there in the room. A disgruntled workforce is an inefficient workforce, and even worse is a fearful one. Shared power breeds better outcomes for morale, productivity, and justice alike.</p>

									<p>And if corporations are to be treated as people under the law, then we must recognize that their soul is not found solely in the corner office, but in the collective heartbeat of their wage-earning workers. Any structure that excludes those workers from power is not only unjust, it is inhuman.</p>
									<p>This isn’t about punishing success, it’s about protecting the people who make that success possible.</p>
