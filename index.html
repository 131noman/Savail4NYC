									<h2>Dear Supporter,</h2>

									<p>New Yorkers hustle, adapt, and show up for one another. But we shouldn’t have to fight alone for basic needs like housing, healthcare, or safe infrastructure. Washington has failed us, and it shows in our daily lives.</p>

									<p>I’m running for Congress here in New York City, not because I planned to, but because I believe this city deserves a federal government as bold and resilient as its people.</p>

									<p>My background spans continents, from public schools in the Midwest to international classrooms in Tokyo and Singapore, where I learned to navigate cultures, challenge systems, and build bridges. Living and working in Mexico deepened my understanding of immigrant struggles and reinforced my belief in justice rooted in solidarity, humility, and inclusion.</p>

									<p>But it wasn’t until I came to New York that things finally clicked. After a life spent searching for belonging, New York, a city of misfits, dreamers, and fighters, was the first place that ever truly felt like home. In its chaos and complexity, I found clarity. I wasn’t lost anymore.</p>

									<p>The journey that brought me here gave me the tools to help others find belonging too, to their country. I’m running to end a system where democracy feels like monarchy, rigged for the ultra-wealthy, with one set of rules for them and another for us. They cry “socialism” when we demand fair and livable wages or healthcare, but stay quiet about corporate bailouts, tax breaks, and loopholes for the rich. That’s not capitalism; it’s feudalism in disguise. I’m fighting for a system that’s accessible, transparent, and actually works for the people it’s meant to serve. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong, and that they have the power to shape this country.</p>

									<p>But after years in the commercial space, I came to a sobering realization: no amount of professional success can compensate for the emptiness of a system where so many are denied stability, dignity, and opportunity. That truth became personal just months ago, when I was scheduled to undergo life-saving brain surgery, only to have my health insurance deny coverage the day before the procedure.</p>

									<p>I was lucky. With the help of friends, family, and a network of advocates, I got the care I needed. But I couldn’t stop thinking: what happens to those without that support? The answer is devastating and unacceptable. The work may have been exciting and cutting-edge, but it felt increasingly hollow in a country where democracy, economic mobility, and healthcare remain out of reach for millions. A truly thriving economy cannot exist without a functioning democracy that delivers for everyone.</p>

									<p>After years of living and working in New York, I’ve seen firsthand how badly we need federal leadership that actually delivers. Our city pays more and gets less on healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and more. It’s time we changed that.</p>

									<p>I’m running to bring that change with experience, urgency, and a deep commitment to people over profits and justice over gridlock.</p>

  								<h1>Policy Platform: A Bold Vision for NY-10</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Pillar One: Affordable Housing for All</h2>
								<h3>The Foreign Ownership Fairness Act & A Federal Renters’ Bill of Rights</h3>
								<p>Housing is a human right, not a speculative asset. While New York offers some of the strongest tenant protections in the country, many Americans face rising rents, weak protections, and predatory investment behavior. This pillar focuses on housing stability, dignity, and fairness.</p>
								<p><strong>Federal Renters’ Bill of Rights</strong> and the <strong>Foreign Ownership Fairness Act</strong> will restore fairness and fight commodification of housing.</p>

								<h3>The Foreign Ownership Fairness Act</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Foreign nationals may own only one residential property, solely for personal use.</li>
									<li>Vacant properties over 180 days face a federal vacancy tax.</li>
									<li>Non-resident shell corporations are barred from acquiring housing units.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>The Federal Renters’ Bill of Rights</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Safe, Habitable Housing</strong>: Federal livability standards and emergency funding for urgent repairs.</li>
									<li><strong>Just-Cause Eviction Protections</strong>: No arbitrary or retaliatory evictions.</li>
									<li><strong>Lease Renewal Protections</strong>: Tenants in good standing retain the right to renew.</li>
									<li><strong>Right to Counsel</strong>: Guaranteed legal support for low/mid-income tenants in eviction court.</li>
									<li><strong>Rent Cap Protections</strong>: Subsidized units capped at CPI + 3% annually.</li>
									<li><strong>Anti-Discrimination</strong>: Nationwide source-of-income protections and strong enforcement.</li>
									<li><strong>Organizing Rights</strong>: Federal protection for tenant unions and collective bargaining.</li>
									<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Mandatory disclosure of ownership, rent history, and violations.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Pillar Two: End Corporate Greed and Restructure the Tax Code</h2>
								<h3>A Fair Share Act + Ultra-Wealthy Tax</h3>

								<h3>Section One: A Fair Share Act</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Eliminate tax loopholes and offshore shelters.</li>
									<li>Enforce minimum effective corporate tax rates.</li>
									<li>Ban deductions for buybacks, lobbying, and excessive bonuses.</li>
									<li>Mandate public tax reporting for corporations.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Section Two: A National Net Worth Tax</h3>
								<p>Tax = 1% + previous year's GDP growth, for assets over $100M.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Applies to stocks, real estate, art, private equity, yachts, and trusts.</li>
									<li>Targets assets held in shell companies or borrowed against.</li>
									<li>Could raise $540B–$900B+ annually.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>What it funds:</strong> Medicare for All, tuition-free education, national housing, green energy, childcare, transit.</p>

								<h2>Pillar Three: No Foreign Military Aid Until Americans Are Cared For at Home</h2>
								<p>No military aid abroad until the U.S. guarantees:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Universal, affordable healthcare</li>
									<li>Accessible, affordable childcare</li>
									<li>Tuition-free higher education</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This approach rejects endless wars and prioritizes domestic justice over foreign entanglements.</p>
								<p>Ending the military-industrial addiction is the only way to real peace, accountability, and global fairness. Military funding must never override justice at home.</p>

								<h2>Pillar Four: Health Insurance Accountability and Affordability - Now</h2>
								<h3>Accountability</h3>
								<p>Health insurers that deny life-saving care must face real penalties. We will classify rejections of critical care as status offenses, triggering automatic liability.</p>

								<h3>Affordability</h3>
								<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Cap insurer profit margins at 1.5% (with a hard limit of 2%).</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Maintains insurer viability</li>
									<li>Eliminates incentives to deny care</li>
									<li>Encourages humane, care-focused models</li>
								</ul>
								<p>It’s not un-American—it’s moral. If private insurers stay, they must serve the public good.</p>

								<h2>Pillar Five: Worker Representation on Corporate Boards</h2>
								<p>It’s time workers had a seat at the table. Inspired by Germany’s co-determination model, this proposal mandates board seats for non-management employees on public companies.</p>
								<p>This will:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Empower workers in corporate decisions</li>
									<li>Improve morale and productivity</li>
									<li>Expose Congressional loyalty to labor or lobbyists</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This isn’t anti-business—it’s pro-worker, pro-fairness, and long overdue.</p>
