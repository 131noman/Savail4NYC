									<p>New Yorkers hustle, adapt, and show up for one another. But we shouldn’t have to fight alone for basic needs like housing, healthcare, or safe infrastructure. Washington has failed us, and it shows in our daily lives.</p>

									<p>I’m running for Congress here in New York City, not because I planned to, but because I believe this city deserves a federal government as bold and resilient as its people.</p>

									<p>My background spans continents, from public schools in the Midwest to international classrooms in Tokyo and Singapore, where I learned to navigate cultures, challenge systems, and build bridges. Living and working in Mexico deepened my understanding of immigrant struggles and reinforced my belief in justice rooted in solidarity, humility, and inclusion.</p>

									<p>But it wasn’t until I came to New York that things finally clicked. After a life spent searching for belonging, New York, a city of misfits, dreamers, and fighters, was the first place that ever truly felt like home. In its chaos and complexity, I found clarity. I wasn’t lost anymore.</p>

									<p>The journey that brought me here gave me the tools to help others find belonging too, to their country. I’m running to end a system where democracy feels like monarchy, rigged for the ultra-wealthy, with one set of rules for them and another for us. They cry “socialism” when we demand fair and livable wages or healthcare, but stay quiet about corporate bailouts, tax breaks, and loopholes for the rich. That’s not capitalism; it’s feudalism in disguise. I’m fighting for a system that’s accessible, transparent, and actually works for the people it’s meant to serve. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong, and that they have the power to shape this country.</p>

									<p>But after years in the commercial space, I came to a sobering realization: no amount of professional success can compensate for the emptiness of a system where so many are denied stability, dignity, and opportunity. That truth became personal just months ago, when I was scheduled to undergo life-saving brain surgery, only to have my health insurance deny coverage the day before the procedure.</p>

									<p>I was lucky. With the help of friends, family, and a network of advocates, I got the care I needed. But I couldn’t stop thinking: what happens to those without that support? The answer is devastating and unacceptable. The work may have been exciting and cutting-edge, but it felt increasingly hollow in a country where democracy, economic mobility, and healthcare remain out of reach for millions. A truly thriving economy cannot exist without a functioning democracy that delivers for everyone.</p>

									<p>After years of living and working in New York, I’ve seen firsthand how badly we need federal leadership that actually delivers. Our city pays more and gets less on healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and more. It’s time we changed that.</p>

									<p>I’m running to bring that change with experience, urgency, and a deep commitment to people over profits and justice over gridlock.</p>

  								<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Bold Vision:</h2> 
								
								<h3 style="text-align: center;">This campaign isn’t about playing it safe — it’s about holding a broken system accountable.</h3>
								
								<!-- Pillar One -->
								<button class="collapsible" style="text-align: Center;">Affordable Housing & Tenant Rights</button>
								<div class="content" display="none">
									<h2>The Foreign Ownership Fairness Act</h2>
										<p></p>To combat artificial demand and absentee speculation, this bill would limit foreign nationals to the purchase of only one residential property in the United States, and only for personal use.<br><br>
										Key provisions include:<br><br><li>Foreign nationals may own one residential unit only, no bulk buying, no real estate hoarding.</li>
										
									<li>Residential properties left vacant for more than 180 days by foreign owners would incur a federal vacancy tax.</li>
									<li>Corporations or shell entities linked to non-residents would be prohibited from purchasing additional units and individuals linked to any such entity shall be precluded from owning any property. </li>
									<br>This proposal directly reduces speculative demand, curbs gentrification pressure, and makes more housing available and affordable to the people who actually live and work in our communities.
									<br><br><p></p>
									<h2>The Federal Renters’ Bill of Rights</h2>
									<p>This legislation would establish national baseline protections for all renters, especially in properties receiving federal subsidies or tax incentives. Key rights include:</p>
									
									<h3><strong>Right to Safe, Habitable Housing</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
										
									<li>Enforceable federal standards for maintenance, pests, air quality, mold, heating, and water access.</li>
									
										<li> Emergency federal funding for urgent “livability” repairs and utility access in under-resourced communities.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h3><strong>Right to Just-Cause Eviction Protections</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Landlords must provide legitimate cause (e.g., non-payment, lease violation) for eviction.</li>
									<li>Ends arbitrary or retaliatory evictions.</li></ul></ul>
									
									
									<h3><strong>Right to Lease Renewal Protections</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Tenants in good standing cannot be denied renewal without just cause.</li>
									<li>Ensures housing stability in rapidly gentrifying or high-demand neighborhoods.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h3><strong>Right to Counsel in Eviction Proceedings</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Federal funding to guarantee legal representation for low- and middle-income tenants.</li>
									<li>Modeled on successful city-level programs like New York City’s Right to Counsel law.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h3><strong>Right to Reasonable Rent Increases</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Federally capped rent increases on subsidized units (e.g., CPI + 3% annually).</li>
									<li>Enables cities and states to build on this floor with stronger protections.</li>
										</ul></ul>


									<h3><strong>Right to Anti-Discrimination Protections</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Nationwide ban on source-of-income discrimination (e.g., against Section 8 voucher holders).</li>
									<li>Enhanced enforcement of existing Fair Housing laws.</li>
									</ul></ul>


									<h3><strong>Right to Organize and Collective Bargain</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Federal protections for tenant unions and associations against retaliation.</li>
									<li>Support for collective bargaining on rent, maintenance, and building conditions.</li>
									</ul></ul>
									
									<h3><strong>Right to Transparency</strong></h3>
									<ul><ul>
									<li>Tenants must be informed of the actual owners and financial interests behind their landlords.</li>
									<li>Mandatory disclosure of rent history, prior code violations, and government subsidies.</li>
										</ul></ul>

								<!-- Pillar Two -->
								<button class="collapsible" style="text-align: Center;">Corporate Greed & Excess Wealth</button>
								<div class="content">
									<br>
									<p>For decades, multinational corporations and ultra-wealthy individuals have extracted billions in profits from our communities while contributing less and less to the public good. It’s time to end this extraction economy and rewrite the tax code to work for working people and ensure that companies benefiting from America’s workforce and infrastructure are paying their fair share to sustain it.</p>
									
									<h2 style="text-align: left;"> A Fair Share Act</h2>
							
										I will push for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate tax code that:
										<ul><ul>
										<li>Eliminates tax loopholes and offshore shelters.</li>
											<li>Enforces a minimum effective tax rate for large corporations.</li>
											<li>Prevents corporations from deducting stock buybacks, lobbying expenses, or executive bonuses from their taxes.</li>
											<li>Requires public reporting of corporate tax liabilities and effective tax rates.</li>
										

										</ul></ul>
									<h2 style="text-align: left;">A National Net Worth Tax on Ultra-Wealthy Individuals</h2>
										<p>The current income-based tax system lets the ultra-wealthy off the hook. Many of the richest Americans report little to no income, despite controlling hundreds of millions to billions in assets. They use those assets as collateral to borrow at low interest rates, avoiding income taxes entirely. This isn’t a loophole, it’s a design failure.</p>
										<p>We propose a Ultra-Wealthy tax equal to 1% plus the previous year’s GDP growth, as reported by a federal index (such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis). For example, if GDP grew by 2%, the tax would be 3% on total net worth for individuals with over $100 million in assets.</p>
										<p>This is not radical, it’s a modest and responsive mechanism based on how the ultra-wealthy actually build wealth: faster than the economy itself. This tax simply ensures that when the country grows, those who benefit most also help sustain it.</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: left;">This tax would apply to:</h3>
										<ul><ul>
											<li>Stocks, real estate, private equity, art, yachts, and trusts.</li>
											<li>Shell company holdings.</li>
											<li>Assets leveraged for loans, whether technically “owned” or “borrowed against.”</li>
										</ul></ul>
								
									<h3 style="text-align: left;">What It Funds: Real Returns for the American People</h2>
									<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Real Revenue Gains</strong></h3>
									
									The top 0.01% of U.S. households control over $18 trillion in wealth. Assuming an average GDP growth of 2–3%, the effective tax rate would hover around 3–4% annually, generating:
									<ul><ul>
										<li>$540–720 billion per year, conservatively.</li>
										<li>As much as $900 billion+ in strong economic years.</li>
										<br>
						
									<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>This revenue could fully fund or dramatically expand:</strong></h4>
										<li>Medicare for All</li>
										<li>Tuition-free public college and vocational programs</li>
										<li>National affordable housing construction</li>
										<li>Green energy and climate resilience projects</li>
										<li>Universal pre-K and childcare access</li>
										<li>Modernized public transit systems</li>
									</ul>	
									</ul>
									<p>All without raising taxes on 99.9% of Americans and potentially lowering them!</p>
									<p>This isn’t about punishment, it’s about preservation. If democracy is to survive, those who have gained the most from it must begin to invest back into it. This tax is a first step toward rebalancing a system that has long asked everything from working people and almost nothing from the top.</p>

									<ul>
									<li>Universal healthcare</li>
									<li>Childcare access</li>

									</ul>
