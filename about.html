                        <p>New Yorkers hustle, adapt, and show up for one another. But we shouldn’t have to fight
                            alone
                            for basic needs like housing, healthcare, or safe infrastructure. Washington has failed
                            us,
                            and it shows in our daily lives.</p>
                        <p>I’m running for Congress here in New York City, not because I planned to, but because I
                            believe this city deserves a federal government as bold and resilient as its people.</p>
                        <p>My background spans continents, from public schools in the Midwest to international
                            classrooms in Tokyo and Singapore, where I learned to navigate cultures, challenge
                            systems,
                            and build bridges. Living and working in Mexico deepened my understanding of immigrant
                            struggles and reinforced my belief in justice rooted in solidarity, humility, and
                            inclusion.
                        </p>
                        <p>But it wasn’t until I came to New York that things finally clicked. After a life spent
                            searching for belonging, New York, a city of misfits, dreamers, and fighters, was the
                            first
                            place that ever truly felt like home. In its chaos and complexity, I found clarity. I
                            wasn’t
                            lost anymore.</p>

                        <p>The journey that brought me here gave me the tools to help others find belonging too, to
                            their country. I’m running to end a system where democracy feels like monarchy, rigged
                            for
                            the ultra-wealthy, with one set of rules for them and another for us. They cry
                            “socialism”
                            when we demand fair and livable wages or healthcare, but stay quiet about corporate
                            bailouts, tax breaks, and loopholes for the rich. That’s not capitalism; it’s feudalism
                            in
                            disguise. I’m fighting for a system that’s accessible, transparent, and actually works
                            for
                            the people it’s meant to serve. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong, and that
                            they
                            have the power to shape this country.</p>

                        <p>But after years in the commercial space, I came to a sobering realization: no amount of
                            professional success can compensate for the emptiness of a system where so many are
                            denied
                            stability, dignity, and opportunity. That truth became personal just months ago, when I
                            was
                            scheduled to undergo life-saving brain surgery, only to have my health insurance deny
                            coverage the day before the procedure.</p>

                        <p>I was lucky. With the help of friends, family, and a network of advocates, I got the care
                            I
                            needed. But I couldn’t stop thinking: what happens to those without that support? The
                            answer
                            is devastating and unacceptable. The work may have been exciting and cutting-edge, but
                            it
                            felt increasingly hollow in a country where democracy, economic mobility, and healthcare
                            remain out of reach for millions. A truly thriving economy cannot exist without a
                            functioning democracy that delivers for everyone.</p>

                        <p>After years of living and working in New York, I’ve seen firsthand how badly we need
                            federal
                            leadership that actually delivers. Our city pays more and gets less on healthcare,
                            housing,
                            infrastructure, and more. It’s time we changed that.</p>

                        <p>I’m running to bring that change with <a href="experience.html" class="link">experience</a>,
                            urgency, and a deep commitment to
                            people
                            over profits and justice over gridlock.</p>
